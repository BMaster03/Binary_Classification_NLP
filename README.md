# 📽️ Binary Classification Model for Movie Reviews using Deep Learning

This project utilizes a **Deep Learning** model to perform binary classification of movie reviews using a **Dense Neural Network**. The goal is to determine whether a review is positive or negative. This code was developed and tested on **Windows 11**.

## 🔧 Requirements

### Python Requirements

Make sure you have **Python 3.12.4** installed on your system. You can check your Python installation by running:

```bash
python --version
Necessary Modules
Install the following libraries using pip:

Keras
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
pydot
graphviz
Creating a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. You can do this with the following commands:

bash
Copiar
Editar
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# For Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# For Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
Installing Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the dependencies using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copiar
Editar
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Ensure that you have pydot and graphviz installed in your global Python environment to correctly generate the architecture image of the neural network.

🚀 Cloning the Repository
You can clone this repository using the following command:

bash
Copiar
Editar
git clone https://github.com/BMaster03/Binary_Classification_NLP.git
Make sure to replace tu_usuario with your GitHub username.

💻 Considerations for Other Operating Systems
Linux
To run the code on Linux, make sure you have Python and the necessary modules installed. The steps are similar to those for Windows. Use:

bash
Copiar
Editar
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
macOS
On macOS, the steps are practically the same. Make sure you have Homebrew installed to manage package installations and use:

bash
Copiar
Editar
brew install python
📈 Running the Code
Once you have installed all the dependencies, you can run the model using:

bash
Copiar
Editar
python main.py
